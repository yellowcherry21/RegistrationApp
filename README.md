# RegistrationApp
## I LOVE MY LIFE
SpringSecurity

With this app u can send post request (with Postman for example) and 
create AppUser, if u send GET request
on http://localhost:8080/registration/confirm?token=[your_token] URL
ull confirm ur user(while app running on local server for example)
idk how it works, but i guess u need PostgreSQl db for Spring Data JPA
